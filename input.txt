Creating VCS Repositories for New Projects
Qt Creator allows you to create repositories for version control systems that support local repository creation, such as Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar. When creating a new project by selecting File > New File or Project, you can choose a version control system on the final wizard page.

You can also select Tools and then select Create Repository in the submenu for the version control system.

To import a project that is under version control, choose File > New Project > Project from Version Control and select the version control system that you use. Follow the instructions of the wizard to import the project.
